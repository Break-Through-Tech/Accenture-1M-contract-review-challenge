## 📋 BTT Internal Evaluation Notes
*(This section is for BTT staff and CAs only — remove before sharing with students)*

### Technical Vetting
| Check | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Python Compatibility | 🟢 | Project utilizes standard libraries (HuggingFace transformers, scikit-learn, pandas) compatible with free-tier Google Colab environments. |
| Data Readiness | 🟡 | CUAD dataset is well-structured but requires significant effort to parse raw PDF text and align token-level labels for 41 categories, which may consume excessive time during early weeks. |
| Resource Check | 🟢 | Project fits within memory constraints; however, fine-tuning large transformer models will require careful batch size management in Colab. |

### Internal Scores
- **Student Fit Score:** 7/10
- **Technical Depth Score:** 8/10
- **Overall Recommendation:** REVISE

### Advisor Feedback Draft
The CUAD-based contract triage pipeline is a high-value industrial use case with excellent potential for technical rigor. To ensure success within the timeframe of the program, I suggest: (i) pivoting from fine-tuning from scratch to utilizing pre-trained lightweight models (e.g., DistilRoBERTa) to reduce hardware overhead demand; and (ii) constraining the scope by focusing on the 10 most impactful clause categories, and having the full 41 as a stretch goal.

# Contract Review Challenge

**Company / Org:** Accenture  
**Challenge Advisor:** Hetal Jetani, [Email address]  
**Program:** Break Through Tech AI Studio - Fall 2026

## 🏢 About Accenture
Accenture is a leading global professional services company that provides a broad range of services and solutions in strategy, consulting, technology, and operations. The team objective for this project is to modernize legal operations by leveraging artificial intelligence to increase the efficiency and accuracy of contract review processes.

## 🎯 The Challenge
### Project Summary
This project involves building a pipeline to automatically detect key clauses in commercial contracts and flag them by risk level (Low, Medium, High) to generate a consolidated triage score. By utilizing the CUAD dataset and applying NLP strategies like multi-label classification and explainable risk-scoring, the team will help legal and procurement departments prioritize high-risk documents. This effort directly addresses the manual labor bottleneck currently faced by teams reviewing thousands of contracts annually.

### Success Criteria
For clause detection: per-category precision/recall/F1. For risk scoring: Spearman correlation and bucket agreement between the model's risk rankings and the advisor's hand-ranked clauses.

### Project Milestones
Use these milestones to guide your work. Your team will create a GitHub Projects board to track tasks within each milestone.
| Month | Milestone | Key Activities |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| **September** | Data Exploration & Preprocessing | Parsing raw CUAD PDFs, text normalization, and establishing token-level label alignment strategies for the target 41 categories. |
| **October** | Feature Engineering & Baseline Modeling | Implementing chunk-based multi-label classification architectures and establishing baseline performance benchmarks using standard transformer encoders. |
| **November** | Model Optimization & Evaluation | Conducting hyperparameter tuning, implementing the rule-based risk-scoring layer, and executing model validation against advisor-provided ground truth. |
| **December** | Insights, Deliverables & Presentation | Finalizing the end-to-end pipeline, calculating reviewer time-saved metrics, and preparing the final technical presentation for stakeholders. |

> **Note for the team:** Please create a GitHub Projects board in this repository to break these milestones into weekly tasks. Go to the **Projects** tab → **New project** → Choose **Board** → Add columns for each month.
